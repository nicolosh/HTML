# HTML
HTML from beginner to advanced ([Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn))

***
Write the title (header) on a page by writing 
```html
<h1>
   The title ...
</h1>
```

Now let's write a paragraph by writing as follows

```html
<p>
   Paragraph element ...
</p>
```
***


***
Now let's write the body to write something on the screen by writing as follows (**better to put all the elements of an html page inside body tags** (this holds for 
```html
   <p> <h1>
```
and more).

Indeed ....

```html
<body>
   <p> What's up? <\p> ...
</body>
```
***

Remember that **p and h1 are at the same level of hierarchy** and another common command in *HTML* is
```html
<div>
   <p> What's your name? <\p>
   <h1> Another header </h1>
</div>
```
