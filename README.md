Write the title (header) on a page by writing 
```html
<h1>
   The title ...

Now let's write a paragraph by writing as follows

<p>
   Paragraph element ...
</p>
```

Now let's write the body to write something on the screen by writing as follows (**better to put all the elements of an html page inside body tags** (this holds for 
```html 
<p>
```
and 
```html
<h1>
```
and more))

```html
<body>
   <p> What's up? <\p> ...
</body>
```
